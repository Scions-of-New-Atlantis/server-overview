<h1>The Laws of New Atlantis&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>General Rules and Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
<li>This is not an official Tarot Sequence server, but an independent fan community. Failure to adhere to rules and community standards will result in Arcana action if necessary.</li>
<ul>
<li>This is an LGBTQ- and diversity-positive server that emphasizes the respect of others&rsquo; experiences and identities. Those found to be acting in a way that is not in line with these general ideals will be asked to exit the server.</li>
<li>This is not the only Tarot Sequence fan server, and members are always welcome to form their own communities if they desire.</li>
<li>We abide by the Discord Terms of Service. Any rule that is not listed here, but is listed in the terms of service in some manner, will apply to this server. Further, the ToS supersedes any rule that we have that might be contrary to their own. https://discordapp.com/terms <a href="https://discordapp.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discordapp.com/guidelines</a></li>
<li><em>You must read &amp; consent to follow the rules. (You won&rsquo;t be able to see/send messages in most of the server until you agree to the rules!)</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Be a reasonable person</li>
<ul>
<li>No rude, offensive, racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, or any other kind of discriminatory or hateful speech allowed at any time. Use member&rsquo;s correct pronouns and do not attempt to deny someone their gender or sexual identity. Toxicity towards users will result in warnings, mutes and later a ban. Hate speech is not permitted.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t talk over people who have had the experience. This means listening to people who belong to the identity being discussed and respecting the fact that they are taking the time to explain their lived experience with you.</li>
<li>Respect boundaries of other members in regards to requesting/sharing personal or sensitive information. This is a public server and personal information such as full name, address, etc. should not be posted. We also do not support doxxing or posting anybody else&rsquo;s personal information.</li>
<li>This is a room full of strangers. As such, information about minors (including photos, etc. of your own children) or other extremely personal/confidential information should not be shared.</li>
<li>We will not all agree on everything and we encourage polite and respectful conversation/discussion, but keep in mind that especially over text, tone can be Tone tags/emojis, while not required, are recommended in situations where your tone might not be obvious from text alone.</li>
</ul>
<li>Be respectful of conversations and channels.</li>
<ul>
<li>Self-moderation is strongly encouraged. If you don&rsquo;t like a topic, conversation, etc., mute the channel/server, visit another channel, take a break, go pet an animal. Come back later.</li>
<li>Concerns regarding sensitivity (racism, homophobia, ableism, etc.) should be approached respectfully with other members or brought to a mod&rsquo;s attention in private.</li>
<li>Keep content to the appropriate channel; content in the wrong channel may be removed. When in doubt, check the rules post for the channel in question.</li>
<li>No shaming/policing of topics, ideas, interests, etc. that do not constitute a clear violation of the rules or channel guidelines.</li>
<li>Avoid dumping. With the exception of #fanworks and #original-works, avoid posting multiple messages/works in a row in order to allow conversation to flow and prevent spamming.</li>
<li>Be mindful of discussions already happening. Check timestamps to make sure a conversation isn&rsquo;t actively occurring before changing topics, use the &ldquo;reply&rdquo; feature (with or without tagging the sender, as is appropriate), and allow a respectful amount of time to pass before posting works in order to give other users the chance to have a discussion of their contributions.</li>
<li>Utilize the spoiler tag liberally, both for actual spoilers and TW/CWs.</li>
<ul>
<li>Required CW/spoiler tags: violence, sexual assault, self-harm &amp; suicide, death, hate speech, homophobia/transphobia, racism. Mods may ask you to add other CW tags or spoilers on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>Note that CWs are still required for discussions of the contents of the books.</li>
<li>Messages needing a spoiler blackout but lacking one will receive a request for the author to spoiler the message. If the message is not quickly corrected, mods reserve the right to delete the message.</li>
</ul>
<li>Any NSFW or explicit content must be kept in the NSFW channels. Access to these channels will only be given to those who specify their age/decade for a Seneschal/Arcana. Please use these channels at your own risk as general explicit content does not require a tag but potentially triggering topics should be warned and tagged. REMINDER: "NSFW" literally means "not safe for work", so if you wouldn't want your boss to see or read it over your shoulder, don't post it in a general channel.</li>
<ul>
<li>While mistakes happen, repeatedly posting NSFW or explicit content in all-ages channels will be grounds for punitive action.</li>
<li>Please check people's roles for pronouns and adult/minor status. Anybody without the adult tag needs to be treated as a minor.</li>
</ul>
<li>If asked to move or spoil content, do not argue with the mod team.</li>
<li>Content theft will not be tolerated. This includes both content posted within the server and sharing of creative content posted behind a paywall/subscription service (e.g. Patreon).</li>
<ul>
<li>When sharing content that is not your own, you must link to original/official sources.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Do not insult the server moderators or become belligerent after being warned. If a mod tells you to stop doing something, stop doing it. Passive aggressive complaining in chat or being openly defiant will help no-one. You will get muted and later banned. While measured discussion regarding the reasons for being warned are encouraged for the education of the user and general public, be aware that at some point Seneschals or Arcana may deem it inappropriate for general chat and send a DM.</li>
<li>Inactive users may be removed. If you are removed for non-violatory reasons and would like to rejoin, you are welcome to do so.</li>
<li>In general, please direct any questions or concerns to a Seneschal or Arcana.</li>
<li>Arcana have, at their reasonable discretion, the ability to remove persons from the server if it is in the best interest of the server and its members, even if a rule has not technically been violated. This is to ensure that members do not attempt to find loopholes to abuse. Punitive measures may be taken for violation of the above rules. The levels of punishment are as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Informal Warning</strong> - A warning mostly given when there are minor violations.</li>
<li><strong>Formal Warning</strong> - A warning given by Major/Minor Arcana via DM. This is a formal warning meant to put a member on notice about gross or continued rule violations, or in matters where it is not ethical to mention the violation in public.</li>
<li><strong>Temporary Mute</strong> - To take place following a rule violation where an in-chat nudge or warning has not remedied the issue, or as a temporary measure taken against someone until a decision can be made regarding further punishment.</li>
<li><strong>Kick</strong> - To take place in instances when a member has acted in an immature manner, but where there are no overt rule violations. They may return if they feel that they've grown in maturity.</li>
<li><strong>Ban</strong> - To take place when it is in the best interest of the server to remove a member permanently from the server. In some instances, an appeal will not be considered, mostly in relation to gross abuse of the server rules. Trolls, bots, and raiders will also be banned without appeal.</li>
<li><em>If you receive a warning, either informal or formal, please acknowledge receipt within 24 hours. If you do not and are active in the server during this time, you may be subject to additional warnings or removal.</em></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Regarding K.D. Edwards</h2>
<p>Please be respectful and aware that, while KD Edwards has brought us this series, he is also a real, living human being whose identity, boundaries, and privacy should be maintained.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have an established relationship with KD, that is between you and him. This is a real person and his privacy, personal space, and boundaries deserve respect. Those found failing to do so within this server will be timed out, given warnings, etc.</li>
<li>Do not encourage users to directly contact KD via private channels. To support the maintenance of his boundaries, communication should be directed to the Q&amp;A form on his website, found here: https://kd-edwards.com/atlantean-archives/questions/. Other brief comments (thanks, etc.) may be submitted via the contact form found here: https://kd-edwards.com/contact/. KD will answer questions as he is able, and hopes to come by to chat as he is able.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Channel-Specific Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
<li>NSFW chat is strictly for discussion revolving around explicit topics and is not for direct sexual interaction between members (no roleplay, sexting, etc).</li>
<ol>
<li>Please limit NSFW photos to art (no nudes/porn). - Remember that all art must be linked from a direct source. No reposting is allowed.</li>
</ol>
<li>Please limit self-promotion to your individual Guild Hall thread(s). In the case of recommendation requests, please ask the requestor before self-recommending.</li>
<ol>
<li>Joining the server for the sole purpose of self promotion/soliciting donations/similar activities is not allowed and will result in a warning.</li>
<li>All personal fundraisers (GoFundMe etc) must be approved by an Arcana. DM an Arcana with the details and wait for approval before posting in the server.</li>
</ol>
<li>Writing snippets and art are not subject to critique unless it is specifically requested. All critique is expected to be constructive and from a place of care. Members found to be regularly providing unwanted or excessively harsh/nitpicky critiques may be removed from the relevant spaces.</li>
<li>Please do not use this server to solicit or offer medical, legal, financial, etc. advice, and exercise caution when providing details of your own experiences or situation. This is for the protection of everyone.</li>
<li>The vent thread is a great catch-all space for all kinds of stressful and touchy subjects including politics, climate change, religious frustrations, family, and more. Please make sure you are using it instead of other areas, as repeated and regular venting in other channels is also subject to Arcana action. Also, please remember that not all vents are requests for advice. Please ensure all vents are spoiled and tagged accordingly.</li>
<li>Spoiler tags are required in the liveblogging channels to protect the content for people who may not be as far into the book as you. Please tag with chapter/page/percentage where relevant.</li>
<li>The Guild Hall is subject to its own additional rules. Please ensure you are informed of and abiding by those if you choose to participate in the Guild Hall. Main channels are designed for general creator chat, and personal threads for sharing progress updates/discussion about individual projects.</li>
<li>Cross-posting the same content across multiple channels will be considered spam.</li>
</ol>
